# amazingbrick-neuroevolution
I recreated the (originally) iOS game Amazing Brick in Javascript using the p5 framework. I then used TensorFlow.js to develop a neuroevolutionary algorithm whose goal is to master the game. The neural network for neuroevolution uses several parameters for its fitness function. These include time alive, time spent in the middle, and score.
